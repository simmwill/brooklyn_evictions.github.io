## Project Overview

Evictions represent a major source of housing instability in the U.S., especially in vulnerable communities. Once a rare phenomenon, eviction has now grown to what many consider "epidemic" proportions, with [over 450,000](https://ny.curbed.com/2017/9/25/16361572/rent-stabilization-map-crown-heights-bushwick) evictions filed in New York City between 2013 and 2015.  

Governments and residents have grown accustomed to this. Entire police units, moving companies, and economic infrastructures have been built upon this, as reported by the [*New Yorker*](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/02/08/forced-out). What factors put individuals, communities, and populations most at-risk for eviction? Who bears the cumulative social and economic consequences of a practice now accepted as commonplace, justified, and even beneficial?

We used data from the [*Eviction Lab*](https://evictionlab.org) at Princeton University to investigate these questions and explore patterns in evictions and eviction filings across Brooklyn from 2010 to 2016. 

Use the tabs above to explore the following questions:

  * How have eviction rates changed over time by census tract in Brooklyn (2000-2016)?
  * Are there spatial patterns in the discrepancy between eviction filings and evictions at the neighborhood level? Do these patterns reflect distributions of other key variables of interest?
  * What factors are associated with eviction rates across census tract in Brooklyn (2010-2016)?
