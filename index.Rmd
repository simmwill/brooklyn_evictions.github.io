## Motivation

Evictions represent a major source of housing instability in the United States, especially in vulnerable communities. Eviction has now grown to what many consider "epidemic" proportions, with [over 450,000](https://ny.curbed.com/2017/9/25/16361572/rent-stabilization-map-crown-heights-bushwick) evictions filed in New York City between 2013 and 2015.  

Entire police units, moving companies, and economic infrastructures have been built in response to this phenomenon, as reported by the [*New Yorker*](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/02/08/forced-out). What factors put individuals, communities, and populations most at-risk for eviction? Who bears the cumulative social and economic consequences of a practice now accepted as commonplace, justified, and even beneficial?

## What you'll find here

We used data from the [*Eviction Lab*](https://evictionlab.org) at Princeton University to explore patterns in evictions and eviction filings across Brooklyn from 2010 to 2016. 

In the Exploratory Analyses tab, you can observe:

  * How eviction rates have changed over time by census tract (2000-2016)
  * Spatial patterns in the discrepancy between eviction filings and evictions at the neighborhood level; whether neighborhoods with high eviction rates and high filings-evictions discrepancies exhibit other markers of disadvantage
  * How the geographic distribution of eviction rates in Brooklyn correlates to other census tract characteristics such as language ability, racial composition, rent burden, and population density

In the [Model building](model_building.html) tab, we propose a model to predict eviction rates in Brooklyn based on historical data. Head to our [Interactive Prediction Model](https://willsimmons.shinyapps.io/model_building/) to try it for yourself!
